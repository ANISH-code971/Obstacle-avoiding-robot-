### **Obstacle-Avoiding Robot with Ultrasonic Sensor**  
An autonomous robot that navigates dynamic environments by detecting and avoiding obstacles using an **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** and **Arduino Nano**. The robot calculates distances in real-time, adjusts its path with an **L293D motor driver**, and responds to proximity thresholds with LED indicators.  

#### **Key Features**:  
- Real-time obstacle detection using ultrasonic waves (distance = speed of sound Ã— echo time).  
- Dynamic movement logic: moves forward, stops, or turns left based on obstacle proximity (<30cm).  
- Hardware: Arduino Nano, HC-SR04, L293D motor driver, DC motors, and LEDs.
